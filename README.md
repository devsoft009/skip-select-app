# Skip-Select Demo (React + Vite + Tailwind)

A compact, single-page React app that modernises the **“Choose Your Skip Size”** step from the We Want Waste booking flow.  
Built for clean code, smooth UX, and true mobile-first responsiveness – **plus a brand-new client-side filter feature I added for size, price, and hire-period.**

## Why this repo exists

1. **Cleaner design** – dark theme, clear hierarchy, subtle animations.  
2. **Better UX** – keyboard-selectable cards, screen-reader announcements, sticky footer.  
3. **Fully responsive** – one column on phones, two on tablets, three on desktop.  
4. **Extra filtering power** – **new** min/max filters let users narrow skips instantly, no extra API calls.  
5. **No surprises** – plain Vite + React + Tailwind; clone, install, run.
